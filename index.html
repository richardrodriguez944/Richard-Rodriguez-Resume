        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> My name is Richard Rodriguez and I am a first generation college student. Being able to further my education has always been a dream of mine. When I was admitted to the University of California, Riverside it was very exciting for me and my family as all the hard work I had done for the past years was finally paid off. Even though I am not done as I havenâ€™t reached my final good which is to achieve my bachelors degree to me, being accepted into one of the top public universities of California is a huge accomplishment. I consider myself to be a very hard working person who is responsible as well. My education has always been a priority. As a first generation student I did not have the path paved for me and I had to find the way myself which was sort of a challenge for me. Being able to overcome this obstacle despite the odds is something huge in my life. I also feel alot of excitement as I feel like I have paved the road for my younger siblings to follow. This is important to me because like I mentioned I had to figure it out on my own as my parents and older siblings' highest level of education was only a highschool diploma. Being able to accomplish this is what I feel like makes me a leader as I believe leaders always lead by example to others. Being able to reach this has now made me set the standards higher for my family and I. I am confident that I would be able to work anywhere and be successful as I always seek to do the best work possible in the most effective way. Also I take pride in what I do no matter how big or small the task I am asked to do. I would consider myself a reliable and responsible person. When it comes to getting something done whether it involves work or school work I put all the effort possible to make sure it is done right. Overall I consider myself a strong candidate for this position.

<br>

        I am currently a student at The University of California, Riverside. I am a first year student seeking a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Administration and Management. With my bachelors degree in this field I Intend to seek jobs where businesses are struggling and are looking to improve in a certain area. As well as I hope to be able to climb the corporate ladder to one day be able to become a CEO for an important company. Another goal I hope to achieve with my bachelors degree is be able to open up a business and be successful. Many people open up businesses and think it is easy but most of them fail within a short period of time. Most of them fail largely because people do not understand the amount of effort and time it requires, as well as any struggles that come along with it. Therefore I plan to use my knowledge in the business industry that will not fail within the first years. Being my own boss and having my own business has always been a dream of mine since I was a young. Entrepreneurship has always been a big part of my life as I have always liked to seek challenges. It may be a huge risk many will not take but I feel like I am a person that will take any challenge regardless of the consequences that may come along with it. I believe that many of the successful people in the world got to where they are today due to them not giving up and taking on those challenges with all those risks. Many fail at first but it is not about that, it is about doing it until you get to what you are trying to achieve. Over time when one continues to try over and over you can see yourself improving and to me that's very important as it wonâ€™t always be correct or the best the first time.There will always be a way to become succesful. I also believe that achieving a bachelor's degree in business adminstration will open up many career opportunities beyond the ones I am currently thinking of.
 <br><br>

          My hobbies in my free time are playing video games and playing as well as watching sports. To be that is a big thing as it helps me relax after a long day of working or doing school work. For instance I have been working since the age of 16. At the age of 16 I got my first job in a mini market as courtesy clerk and meat clerk. My duties included helping to stock items around the store and being able to organize anything that was needed. Meanwhile as a meat clerk I was in charge of helping the butcher organize the different kinds of meats as well as to prepare them. I was also responsible for helping customers with whatever they needed. I believe my first job really helped me be able to improve my skills in being able to interact better with customers. Being able to interact with people is a huge thing because in most jobs you're constantly working with people. Being able to work since a young age really has helped me be more responsible and work for what I want and not depend on others. As well as teaching me how to  manage my time. Being able to work and go to school can really be stressful at times but also helps one focus and be productive and not waste much time doing nothing. At the age of 17 I was able to get another job after working for one year at the store. I found a job in a construction clean up company where I work as a window cleaner. In my new job I have been able to carry on skills previously learned such as those like communication. It is a huge thing as you must communicate with the construction managers in order to be able to get the job done as they desire. Also to be able to manage my time and get the most work done in a timely manner. Overall all my skills that I have improved and developed over time through my jobs has helped me be more successful in school and will help for future jobs.
